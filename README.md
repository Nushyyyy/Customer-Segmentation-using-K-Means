# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview
Customer segmentation is a key marketing strategy that helps businesses understand customer behavior and personalize offerings.  
This project applies **unsupervised machine learning** using **K-Means clustering** on the Mall Customers dataset to identify distinct customer groups based on income and spending behavior.

---

## Objectives
- Segment customers into meaningful groups
- Analyze purchasing behavior patterns
- Enable data-driven marketing and customer targeting strategies

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Plotly**
- **Matplotlib**

---

## Dataset
**Mall Customers Dataset**

### Features Used:
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1–100)

> The dataset represents customer demographics and purchasing behavior in a retail mall.

---

## Methodology
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Feature selection
3. Feature scaling using **StandardScaler**
4. Optimal cluster selection using the **Elbow Method**
5. Cluster validation using **Silhouette Score**
6. Customer segmentation using **K-Means clustering**
7. Cluster profiling and business interpretation
8. **PCA** for 2D visualization of clusters
9. **DBSCAN** for density-based clustering comparison

---

## Key Metrics
- **Silhouette Score** (≈ 0.5+)
- Cluster sizes
- Customer segment profiles

---

## Customer Segments Identified
- **High-Value Loyal Customers**
- **Careful / Conservative Spenders**
- **Impulse Buyers**
- **Budget-Conscious Customers**
- **Young Exploratory Customers**

Each segment represents a unique customer persona useful for targeted marketing.

---

## Business Insights
- Enables personalized marketing strategies
- Identifies premium customers for loyalty programs
- Helps optimize promotional campaigns
- Detects anomalous customer behavior using DBSCAN

---

## Model Comparison
### K-Means
- Requires predefined number of clusters
- Best suited for marketing segmentation
- Sensitive to outliers

### DBSCAN
- No need to specify number of clusters
- Detects noise and outliers
- Useful for anomaly detection

---

## Results
- Clear and interpretable customer clusters
- Interactive visualizations for decision-making
- Actionable insights for business strategy

---

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate RFM analysis with transactional data
- Deploy as an interactive dashboard
- Integrate real-time customer segmentation

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **unsupervised learning techniques** can transform customer data into valuable business insights, enabling effective segmentation and targeted marketing strategies.
